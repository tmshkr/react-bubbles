## Explain what a token is used for.

A web token is used for authorization, in order to ensure that only a logged-in user can access private resources. After logging in, the server provides the client with a token, which the client can then send to the server with subsequent requests in order to verify that it has been authenticated.

## What steps can you take in your web apps to keep your data secure?

It is recommended to only keep the token as long as it is required, so the client should be reauthenticated by the server as necessary. If persistent storage is not needed, it is recommended to not store tokens in `localStorage` because it is vulnerable to XSS attacks.

## Describe how web servers work.

Web servers are publicly accessible from the Internet by their IP address, which is mapped to their domain name though the process of DNS resolution. The web browser makes a request to a DNS service, which receives the URL and returns its associated IP address. From there, the request from the web browser is routed through several Internet nodes in order to make a connection between the web browser and the server, so that they can exchange data. The data can be static files like an HTML page and JavaScript, or dynamic content generated by the server.

## Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.

* Create => POST
* Read => GET
* Update => PUT
